# PUSHILLADE

![a screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true ":)")

A fast (~8h) js remix of the_pchanina for dercz9000 console (cf https://github.com/drcz/dercz9000),
prepared for [the last few hours of] mini Ludum Dare 67.

Eliminate all the niderite crystals by pushing one onto another.
Avoid ants, open doors with keys, oh my.
You can even try to kill ants with niderite, but it's not easy.

Controls: arrow keys, or WSAD, or by tapping/clicking near the border (even more annoying than the tune!).

Gfx from the_pchanina, excluding fonts made today [everything drawn in emacs].

Implementation based on "ego blocks engine" of https://github.com/drcz/ludum-dare-35/tree/master/3Ro2CSiaMoT

Level design from the_pchanina.

Annoying tune made in ModPlug Tracker some 11 years ago, slightly uglified today.


In short, it's an ugly collage of previous stuff, but we're all gonna die so no worries.
